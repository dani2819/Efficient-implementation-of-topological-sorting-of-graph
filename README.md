# Implementation-of-topological-sorting-of-graph
It is a Python implementation of Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting of graphs. It uses Networkx library for performing graph operations. Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

# Pseudocode of Kahn's Algorithm
L ← Empty list that will contain the sorted elements

S ← Set of all nodes with no incoming edges
while S is non-empty do
    remove a node n from S
    add n to tail of L
    for each node m with an edge e from n to m do
        remove edge e from the graph
        if m has no other incoming edges then
            insert m into S
if graph has edges then
    return error (graph has at least one cycle)
else 
    return L (a topologically sorted order)
